Build your own toolchain
------------------------

- Download crosstool-ng and checkout the same commit
  as used in the training lab instructions.

- Configure crosstool-ng for generating an ARM toolchain
  optimized for ARM Cortex A9

  Then modify the configuration to generate
  a toolchain using the "uClibc" C library.

- Make sure you can compile the hello.c example
  provided in ~/embedded-linux-labs/toolchain/

- An alternative for this lab (if you are out of time)
  is to download and install the latest bleeding edge
  armv7-eabihf toolchain from https://toolchains.bootlin.com
