Install Ubuntu
--------------

- Install Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit) on one of your systems.
  You can go to https://ubuntu.com/#download for a native
  installation.

- If you cannot make space for a separate Linux partition on
  your (Windows?) system, an alternative is to install VirtualBox
  (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and download and use our virtual
  machine image:

  https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/bootlin-big-files/training/ubuntu-20.04-20200617.ova

  In Virtualbox, you just have to use File -> Import Appliance
  to create a new virtual machine from this image.

  In this VM, here are the credentials:
  User: tux
  Password: tux

- At the end, download and extract the below archive
  into your home directory:
