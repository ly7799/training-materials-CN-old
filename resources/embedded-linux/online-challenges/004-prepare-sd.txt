Prepare SD card
---------------

Goal: prepare an SD card image
- to contain the zImage and DTB file for booting
  (instead of booting the kernel directly
  from the QEMU command line)
- to contain the future root filesystem

- Using the dd command, create a 1 GB file
  filled with zeros, called "sd.img"
  This will be used by QEMU as an SD card disk image

- Run "cfdisk sd.img" and create the same partitions
  as in the "Block filesystems lab":
  - Partition 1: primary, 64M, bootable, "FAT16" type
  - Partition 2: primary, 8M, "Linux" type (default)
  - Partition 3: primary, all remaining space, "Linux" type (default)
  Write the changes and quit

- Now use the loop driver to emulate block devices
  from this image and its partitions:

  sudo losetup -f --show --partscan sd.img

  -f: finds a free loop device
  --show: shows the loop device that it used
  --partscan: scans the loop device for partitions
    and creates additional /dev/loop<x>p<y> block
    devices.

- Using such devices, you can now format the 3 partitions:
  - Partition 1: FAT16, with "boot" label
  - Partition 2: ext4, with "root" label
  - Partition 3: ext4, with "data" label

- Last but not least, mount the first partition and
  copy the zImage and dtb file to it.

- Unmount the first partition and release the loop device:
  sudo losetup -d /dev/loop<x>
