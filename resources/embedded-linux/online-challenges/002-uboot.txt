Compile and test U-Boot on QEMU
--------------------------------

- Install the qemu-system-arm package

- Configure your environment to use the cross toolchain
  that you used.

- Download U-Boot v2020.04 and configure it for
  to support the ARM Vexpress Cortex A9 board (vexpress_ca9x4_defconfig)

- Compile U-Boot using your toolchain
  This generates several binaries, including "u-boot" and "u-boot.bin"

- Still in U-Boot sources, test that U-Boot works:
  qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 128M -nographic -kernel u-boot

  -M: emulated machine
  -m: emulated RAM
  -kernel: allows to load the binary directly in the emulated
   machine and run the machine with it. This way, you don't
   need a first stage bootloader. Of course, you don't
   have this with real hardware.

  Note: to exit QEMU, run the below command in another terminal:
  killall qemu-system-arm

- In the U-Boot prompt, type "help"  to see what commands
  are supported.

  In later challenges, we will add SD card storage to the
  emulated machine, so that we can load a kernel from such
  storage.

  But at this stage, you don't know how to create filesystem
  images yet.
