Root filesystem with Buildroot
------------------------------

This challenge is derived from our "Buildroot" lab. Look
at this lab for further instructions.

The goal is to add rebuild the root filesystem with an audio player
and play the sample sound.

The command to run QEMU is the same. The emulated hardware already
has sound support.

Known issue: the sample.ogg sample will play in a weird way
in QEMU (investigating, but no solution found yet). To have a
correct result, add support for the "aplay"
command in alsa-utils, and play the same in WAV format:
