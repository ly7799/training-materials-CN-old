Compile and test the Linux kernel on QEMU
-----------------------------------------

- Download the latest 5.6 release of Linux

- Configure the environment to compile Linux
  for ARM with your toolchain.

- Configure your kernel for the ARM Vexpress
  boards (vexpress_defconfig)

- Add CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT to the configuration

- Compile your kernel

- Test your kernel:
  qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 128M -nographic -kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage  -append "console=ttyAMA0" -dtb arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

  -append: Linux kernel command line parameters

  Make sure that Linux reaches the point where it panics because
  it is unable to mount a root filesystem.
  We will create one in the next challenge.

  In the next challenge, we will also load the zImage and dtb
  from U-Boot after storing them in a FAT32 sdcard partition.
