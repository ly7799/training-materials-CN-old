\subchapter{Measure boot time - Software solution}{Objective: measure
boot time with software only solutions}

During this lab, we will use techniques to measure boot time using only
software solutions.

\section{Timing messages on the serial console}

Let's use \code{grabserial} to time all the messages received in the
serial console, from the first stage bootloader to launching the final
application:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt install grabserial
\end{verbatim}

We are now ready to time the messages in the serial console. First, exit
from Picocom (\code{[Ctrl][a] [Ctrl][x]}). Then, power off your board,
remove its USB power supply and run:

\begin{verbatim}
grabserial -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -t -e 30
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{-t} Displays the time when the first character of each line
was received.
\item \code{-e} Specifies the {\bf e}nd time when \code{grabserial}
will exit.
\end{itemize}

Now, insert the USB power cable and see the console messages with their
timing information:

\begin{verbatim}
[0.000001 0.000001]
[0.000235 0.000234] U-Boot SPL 2019.01 (May 17 2019 - 05:15:21 +0200)
[0.058954 0.058719] Trying to boot from MMC1
[0.128419 0.069465] Loading Environment from FAT... *** Warning - bad CRC, using default environment
[0.153105 0.024686]
[0.169676 0.016571] Loading Environment from MMC... OK
[0.523465 0.353789]
[0.523647 0.000182]
[0.523722 0.000075] U-Boot 2019.01 (May 17 2019 - 05:15:21 +0200)
...
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, the time to start U-Boot SPL can be neglected. We can
use the \code{U-Boot SPL} string as a reference point for timing. This way,
we don't have to power off the board every time we wish to make a
measurement. Resetting the board will be sufficient.

So, let's run \code{grabserial} again:

\begin{verbatim}
grabserial -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -m "U-Boot SPL" -t -e 30
\end{verbatim}

\section{Timing the execution of the application}

Bootlin prepared a patch to \code{ffmpeg} to issue a message in its logs
after decoding and displaying the first frame. Let's instruct Buildroot
to apply it!

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir -p board/beaglecam/patches/ffmpeg/
cp ../data/0001-ffmpeg-log-notification-after-first-frame.patch \
   board/beaglecam/patches/ffmpeg/
\end{verbatim}

Then, tell Buildroot to look for patches in this directory, by adding
\code{board/beaglecam/patches} to the
\code{BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR} configuration setting (through \code{make
menuconfig} or by directly editing the \code{.config} file.

Then, rebuild \code{ffmpeg}:

\begin{verbatim}
make ffmpeg-dirclean
make
\end{verbatim}

Note that \code{make ffmpeg-rebuild} wouldn't be sufficient to apply a
newly added patch.

Let's add something else before updating the root filesystem image...

\section{Timing the launching of the application}

To measure the time the application takes to load and execute, it's also
very useful to time the instant when the application is started.

So, let's also modify \code{board/beaglecam/rootfs-overlay/etc/init.d/S50playvideo}
to add the below line before running \code{ffmpeg}:

\begin{verbatim}
echo "Starting ffmpeg"
\end{verbatim}

Now we can update the root filesystem image:

\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}

After reflashing the SD card, reset the board and check that you are
getting the new message. You can now measure the time between starting
\code{ffmpeg} and finishing processing the first frame.

Thanks to the last message, we can now stop \code{grabserial} when it's
received, replacing the \code{-e} argument:

\begin{verbatim}
grabserial -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -m "U-Boot SPL" -t -e 30 -q "First frame decoded"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Initial measurements}

Now, take your calculator and fill the below table with the results from your experiments:

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | r |}
  \hline
  Step & Duration & Description \\
  \hline
  \hline
  U-Boot SPL & & Between \code{U-Boot SPL 2019.01} and \code{U-Boot 2019.01} \\
  \hline
  U-Boot & & Between \code{U-Boot 2019.01} and \code{Starting kernel} \\
  \hline
  Kernel & & Between \code{Starting kernel} and \code{Run /sbin/init} \\
  \hline
  Init scripts & & Between \code{Run /sbin/init} and \code{Starting ffmpeg} \\
  \hline
  Application & & Between \code{Starting ffmpeg} and \code{First frame decoded} \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Total & & \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
