\subchapter{Ubuntu installation}{Set up the Linux distribution: Ubuntu 20.04}

\section{Option 1: native installation}

Go to \url{https://ubuntu.com/#download}, download the Desktop edition
and then follow the instructions.

You don't have to replace your existing operating system completely.
Just make some free space (at least 30 GB for Ubuntu and the labs
we will run) and install Ubuntu alongside your existing system.

\section{Option 2: using a VirtualBox virtual machine}

In case you have to keep your existing operating system and
dual-booting is not an option, another option is to download VirtualBox
(\url{https://www.virtualbox.org/}) and download and use our virtual
machine image from
\url{https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/bootlin-big-files/training/ubuntu-20.04-20200617.ova}

You will still need something like 30 GB of free space to run all the
labs comfortably.

In Virtualbox, you just have to use {\code File -> Import Appliance}
to create a new virtual machine from this image.

In this VM, here are the credentials:
\begin{itemize}
\item User: \code{tux}
\item Password: \code{tux}
\end{itemize}
